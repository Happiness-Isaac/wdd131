                <p>And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily
                    provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth
                    all
                    things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</p>

                <h2>Alma 9:14</h2>
                <p>Now I would that ye should remember, that inasmuch as the Lamanites have not kept the commandments of God, they
                    have
                    been cut off from the presence of the Lord. Now we see that the word of the Lord has been verified in this
                    thing, and
                    the Lamanites have been cut off from his presence, from the beginning of their transgressions in the land.</p>
